<p><pre><b>Dear All,</b>

It's been a pretty small gap from 2013 to 2015. Galaata 2015 (TSC-AFI Sports Event) is back but this time it is Bigger and Better...! I would like to borrow few minutes of your valuable time traverse the memory lane and highlight few events that had brought smiles/ giggles / laughter / joy while we clocked our best at work.

<b>What is Galaata?</b>
Galaata is a TCS-AFI sporting event which has a base theme of  "fun and frolic". The true intention of Galaata is to enrich synergy between teams thereby collaborating for maximum output at work.

<b>What is special about Galaata 2015?</b>
Last time it was completely based on the theme of " Let's AMPlify" and this year the theme for Galaata is " Let's make it Bigger and Better". You all would have already witnessed the grandness in the opening format of APL (Ameriprise Premier League). It was one of it's kind! Also it is worth mentioning that this year we have some of our customers will be part of this eventful agenda, which helps in bonding as partners at work. This year the focus is also to adhere to the Diversity & Inclusion aspect of including female associates into all top decision making committees. Arunima Mitra is one such inclusion who is part of core committee championing many roles within this event. 

<b>What is APL and what happened during auction?</b>
APL is acronym for Ameriprise Premier League (Cricket). In order to synonymously adhere to the tag line "Let's make it Bigger and Better", Abhishek came out with a wonderful idea of having IPL auction simulated for APL. It worked and the synergy between team leads worked wonder. This is the real collaboration and ice breaker session that one could imagine. 

In order to know more log on to Knowme https://knome.ultimatix.net/communities/11675-gallata-2015 (Idea courtesy : Srinivas from Data Mgmt Team)

Debi Prasad worked on creating a new tool using excel for the auction which was mind-blowing! Along with Sridhara the duo knocked the best during APL auction

<b>What all games planned for this year?</b>
Cricket (APL), Carrom, Chess, Minute To Win It, Dumb Charade, Quiz, Video, Mobile App Build contest. 

All the creative/ mind games are based on corporate themes like 
1. Default is digital
2. TCS Fit4Life/ Purpose For Life
3. Safety First
4. Diversity & Inclusion
5. RYP (Realize Your Potential)

<b>What are the timelines?</b>
We have officially kick started Galaata 2015 as part of APL auction held on 7th July 2015. On 17th and 20th APL will be done, followed by we will open the indoor games sessions. All the games and fixtures are meticulously planned in such a way that none of the associate needs to step out of work. Work and deliverables are given highest priority while planning the games slot for players to compete. Tentative date for Galaata 2015 closure is Aug 7th/ 8th.

<b>How this benefits associates, customer and organization?</b>
All work and no play makes not only Tom but also Shyam a dull boy. The core focus to improve team synergy, collaboration thereby leading to better communication channels for future interactions between teams. This event also encompasses the need for teams to know and glorify the corporate vision for Default is digital, D&I, Fit4life, RYP and Safety related agenda. This event happens across all 3 offshore locations with same spirit and energy. These events also improves in delivery efficiency by refining associate focus and strategic thinking.

<b>How such large number participate?</b>
This event also helps in building future leaders by exposing them to run organizing committees and inspire them to lead through challenging situations. The overall structure is governed by a core committee followed by individual gaming committee. The entire offshore strength at one location is split into 4 houses and each house will have a owner & co-owner and they in-turn appoint captains and vice-captains (Jr associates). To add more fun and spice we have creative teams and reporters / editorial teams. Below is the first publication of Galaata 2015 Newsletter for your reading pleasure
